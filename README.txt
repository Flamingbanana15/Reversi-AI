Reversi Game

A version of reversi/othello programed in C++.
It uses a minimax algorithm to make intelligent decisions.
This alorithm uses a heuristic map, the mobility and stability
of each piece, and the game score to figure out the best move.

This version is still not that smart and can be consistantly beaten.
